The model was first trained using a reduced dataset (1000 images per letter) to reduce execution time for debugging purposes.
The code corresponding to this is in the 'Reduced Dataset' directory. Notably, the output had plenty of mistakes and therefore 
not used for sentiment analysis.

The code corresponding to the complete dataset of images is in the 'Complete Dataset' directory.
